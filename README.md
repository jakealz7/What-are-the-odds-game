# What-are-the-odds-game
Evaluate different strategies in a game of "What are the odds"

## Rules:
* The matcher says "What are the odds you do [something unpleasant]?"  
* The no matcher gives a number n  
* They count down from 3 and then both say a number simultaneously  
* If their numbers are the same or their numbers sum to n, the matcher wins and the no matcher must do the unpleasant thing they agreed upon  

## Question:
If the no matcher chooses any number less than n their opponent has 2 possible options that will cause the no matcher to lose, but if they choose n then there is only one possible number that causes the no matcher to win. What is the optimal strategy for different values of n for each player, and is there a Nash equilibrium?
